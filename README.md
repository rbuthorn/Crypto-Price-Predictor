# Cryptocurrency Price Predictor

## Project Description
This program aims to predict the price of a cryptocurrency given the current sentiment about the currency. There are three parts to this project:
1. Refactor a sentiment analysis tool I made in spring 2023 so that it can be used for analyzing the sentiment of tweets and reddit posts about cryptocurrencies. 
2. Once this is finished, I can use reddit and twitter API's in order to pull all historical tweets/reddit posts about a specific cryptocurrency. Once I have compiled these into one place, I can analyze the sentiment. Then, I will use mahcine learning to see if there is any correlation between the sentiment of a currency and its price.
3. If this is successful, I will apply it to current cryptocurrencies and try to predict the price of these cryptos using this program.

## Credits
All code here was created by Robert Buthorn (myself) and teaching assistants from a natural language processing class I took in spring semester 2023. I have encrypted this file as it is against school guidelines to post the file publicly anywhere online. All other code should be visible besides the sentiment analysis tool.

## Extra
The main file is a Jupyter Notebook containing comments and cell outputs of the code. These descriptions should provide more of a comprehensive outline of what this project accomplished.
